Lesson 7, Linear vs. Parallel findings

Linear import time 2.98 seconds
Parallel import time = 1.35 seconds

Parallel implementation shows a 1.63 second improvement which is 2.2 times faster.

A parallel implementation might need to be reconsidered if the files being imported effected multiple collections in the database. If that was the case, I would consider implementing a system that uses thread locks, at which point we would reconsider the efficiency of a parallel implementation.  

For the system as it is currently setup, I would recommend a parallel implementation using threading.
