In the parallel file I avoided contention between my threads by having each thread write to its
own list. These lists are changed to tuples and returned as a list of tuples at the end that don't
need to be combined so avoiding writing to the same list works well. I also pass different database
tables to write to instead of the same table, mongodb also has it's own locking during inserts.

My findings for changing from linear to parallel yielded around 45% improvement. During a run of
linear it took ~1.131177s while running the same files with parallel reduced the time to
~0.611577s. For my parallel strategy I used threading.
