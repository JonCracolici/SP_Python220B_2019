Our timing experiment yields some useful information.

As expected, the slowest portion of the program is the import code.

The good news is that it seems to scale at better than O(n_records), possibly at
O(log(n_records)).

Data (from timings.txt):

n_records       total_import_time
3000            0.26 sec
30000           0.82 sec
300000          6.43 sec
