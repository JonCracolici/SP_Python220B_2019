For the initial timing I chose to focus on the times it took to:
- append the date info to the list
- add up the year counts
- count the number of ao's found

The results showed the actions took approximately 8.631 seconds to complete.

/usr/local/bin/python3.7 ... time_poor_perf.py
4.059319221 seconds to append new dates to the list
1.3936375920000001 seconds to add up year counts
3.1790028109999993 seconds to count the number of ao's found

I decided to optimize the code by doing the following:
- only read/loop over the file once
- add the new year data directly to the dictionary

This resulted in the time to complete the actions be shrunk down to approximately 3.826 seconds

/usr/local/bin/python3.7 ... time_good_perf.py
3.826443421 seconds to loop over the file and add new dates and ao count
