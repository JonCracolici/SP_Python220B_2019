1.  Function Execution Times for short records (~10)
   
    import_data: .06682 seconds
    show_available_products: .00499 seconds
    show_rentals: .00898 seconds

2.  Function Execution Times for long records (~1000)
    
    import_data: .15711 seconds
    show_available_products: .02194 seconds
    show_rentals: .01093 seconds
    
    
3.  As expected, the larger databases yield longer function
    execution times. However, the execution times don't increase
    by much, at least for records on the order of 1000 entries.
    It will scale up as the number of entries increase, but at
    these quantities, the difference in time is fairly negligible.
