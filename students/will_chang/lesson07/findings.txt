1. The .csv files were updated to have 1000
   entries each. Running linear.py took a
   total of .133 seconds to complete the
   imports of the 3 files.
   
2. Threading was used in parallel.py to bring
   the total time to 0.0878 seconds, reducing
   the execution time by about 34%.
   
3. I would probably not recommend the change to
   management unless the dataset is extremely large.
   Although the percent improvement is substantial,
   the actual execution time was reduced by less than
   one second. For larger sets of data, this 33%
   reduction would become far more apparent and
   a business case could be justified.
