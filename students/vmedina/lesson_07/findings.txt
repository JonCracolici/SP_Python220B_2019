Lesson 7 Findings

Parallel: .0214 seconds
Linear: .052 seconds

Parallel is roughly 2x faster. Given this is only comparing 1000 records
I'd expect the difference to grow as the record count grows.

Parallel runs faster since it utilizes parallelization for better performance.
Since the imports are independent from one another it is more efficient to split the
task into subtasks and assign each subtask to separate processors. Then while each subtask
is being computed in parallel it is later combined for the final results at the end.
