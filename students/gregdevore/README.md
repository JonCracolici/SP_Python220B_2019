# Greg DeVore

* I currently work as an engineer and software developer for Boeing
* My background is in Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mathematics
* I have been using Python for 10 years, but have never taken a formal course
	* Iâ€™m taking this course because I want to be a stronger programmer
	* I want to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and be able to code at a professional level
* My primary uses for Python are scientific computing, data science, and machine learning
